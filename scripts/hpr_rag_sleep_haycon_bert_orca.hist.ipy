Over the years I\'ve tried countless times, all with the same result.\n## hpr4034 :: Sleep Tips   https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia A circadian rhythm (/sərˈkeɪdiən/), or circadian cycle, is a natural oscillation that repeats roughly every 24 hours. Circadian rhythms can refer to any process that originates within an organism (i.e., endogenous) and responds to the environment (is entrained by the environment).\nwakeup script:  #! /bin/bash audacious &  sleep 5s  audacious -p &   You\'ve noticed that the "wakeup" script doesn\'t actually have any timing involved; If you want to use it as an alarm, you get to combine it with the bash "sleep" command.\nTake care of your eyes, use dark theme for night and daily browsing. This eye-care extension enables night mode creating dark themes for websites on the fly.\nI drink maybe four or five cups a day, depending on how early I get into work.

Establishing a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day.\n2. Creating a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading or taking a warm bath.\n3. Ensuring your sleep environment is conducive to sleep, by keeping the room dark, quiet, and cool.\n4. Limiting exposure to screens and bright light before bedtime, as they can interfere with your body\'s production of melatonin, the hormone that helps regulate sleep.\n5. Getting regular exercise during the day, but avoiding vigorous activity close to bedtime.\n6. Managing stress and practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, before bedtime.\n7. Avoiding caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol close to bedtime, as they can disrupt sleep.\n8. Drinking enough water throughout the day, but not too close to bedtime to avoid needing to get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom.\n9.
